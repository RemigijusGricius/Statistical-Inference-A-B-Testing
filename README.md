## Problem Statement

The fast-food restaurant aims to introduce a new product to the market but is unsure about the most effective promotion method. Therefore, an experiment was conducted using three different promotion strategies across various locations and market segments.

## Objective

Evaluate the results of the A/B testing and identify which marketing strategy yields the highest sales effectiveness.

## Additional Information

Detailed information about the experiment's process, statistical analyses conducted, and in-depth results interpretation can be found in a Word document included in this repository.

## Summary of Results

Upon statistical analysis, it was found that Promotion1 demonstrated a significant increase in sales compared to Promotion2. However, no statistically significant difference was observed between Promotion1 and Promotion3, despite Promotion1 achieving higher average sales. The experiment's results were compromised due to uneven distribution across markets, impacting the reliability of conclusions drawn.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, it is recommended to redesign the experiment with a more balanced distribution of promotions across different market areas to ensure more reliable and actionable results. In the interim, if immediate action is necessary, Promotion1 is suggested as it showed a significant sales increase compared to Promotion2 and maintained higher average sales compared to Promotion3, though not statistically significant.
